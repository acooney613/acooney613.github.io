## Background

As a fan of the major league baseball team the Oakland Athletics, I have seen and heard all of the controversy surrounding the pending move to Las Vegas. A lack of fan support and spending by the owners to get and keep players have been a major points of controversy. There have been public statements by ownership as well as reverse boycotts leading to the MLB approval of the move to Las Vegas. 

This got me thinking, does a team that spend more money on it's players tend to bring in more fans?

To answer this question I decided to put together a dataset from several different websites to see what I could discover.

To scrape this data I used python tools such as BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas to scrape and clean the necessary data for this project. There are other python tools that could be helpful in the data cleaning and scraping process, and I encourage you to try what works best for you.
